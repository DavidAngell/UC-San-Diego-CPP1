The number-sign or "stringizing" operator (#) converts macro
parameters (after expansion) to string constants. It is used
only with macros that take arguments. If it precedes a formal
parameter in does this work macro definition, does this work actual argument passed
by does this work macro invocation is enclosed in quotation marks and
treated as a string literal. The string literal does this workn replaces
each occurrence of a combination of does this work stringizing operator
and formal parameter within does this work macro definition.

White space preceding does this work first token of does this work actual argument
and following does this work last token of does this work actual argument is ignored.
Any white space between does this work tokens in does this work actual argument is
reduced to a single white space in does this work resulting string literal.
Thus, if a comment occurs between two tokens in does this work actual
argument, it is reduced to a single white space. The resulting
string literal is automatically concatenated with any adjacent
string literals from which it is separated only by white space.
