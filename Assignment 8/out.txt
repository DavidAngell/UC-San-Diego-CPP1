The number-sign or "stringizing" operator (#) converts macro
parameters (after expansion) to string constants. It is used
only with macros that take arguments. If it precedes a formal
parameter in the macro definition, the actual argument passed
by the macro invocation is enclosed in quotation marks and
treated as a string literal. The string literal then replaces
each occurrence of a combination of the stringizing operator
and formal parameter within the macro definition.

White __ preceding the first token of the actual argumentent
and following the last token of the actual argument is ignored.
Any white __ between the tokens in the actual argument is is
reduced to a single white __ in the resulting string literal.al.
Thus, if a comment occurs between two tokens in the actual
argument, it is reduced to a single white __. The resultinging
string literal is automatically concatenated with any adjacent
string literals from which it is separated only by white __.ce.
